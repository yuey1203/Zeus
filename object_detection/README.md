# Object Detection, Tracking, Distance Estimation, and Avoidance

1. Read in Point Cloud data from Intel Realsense
- focus on this later because not sure what OS we will use so don't waste time on this
- assume I have some point cloud loaded fromo .pcd file

2. Filter vertical distance too remove ground plane
3. Apply Voxel Filtering
4. Perform Clustering, not kmeans because can be arbitrary number of objects
